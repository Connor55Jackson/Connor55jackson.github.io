    <h1>What I Want</h1>
    <p>
    What I want is to graduate with a degree in engineering, but before that I want to be able to find what field of engineering I will end up going into.  I don't know where I am going to be but I want my friends to be there and to be there for others that are in need.  I want to be someone that people can rely on.  Coming back with the engineering, I find it a way I can help others and I want to be able to leave with an education and a job that I will be able to live off of and enjoy.
