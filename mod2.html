    <h1>Friends and Family</h1>
    <p>
    I have two brothers and one sister.
      <li>Ashleigh is my only sister. She is 20 and attending University of New England.</li>
      <li>Jake is the youngest, currently in high school at the age of 15.</li>
      <li>James is the oldest at the age of 25 and is a pharmacist.  He had graduated from Husson University.</li>
    I only have two friends from home named Brendan and Alex.  Brendan is a senior in high school and Alex is a Freshmen at Thomas College.  I have made new friends since I have been here but to many to name but they all mean a lot to me.
