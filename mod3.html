    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
    I play a lot of video games in my free time.  The games that I prefer is GTA V, Call of Duty, Fortnite, Minecraft, and Assassins Creed.  I like these games because they all have a little piece of realism within the games.  Video games are a way for me to escape the real world and go to a place where I can be anyone or anything.  It helped me through high school and when ever I was going through a hard time they just helped me escape.
